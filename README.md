# Witty

Witty is a little project I built to practice building GUIs in python and to get more familiar with Pandas and Thread objects.

The goal of Witty is to gather user input from text fields, pass that data from the frontend to the backend DataManager, save the entry to a csv and then execute another file in the background without interrupting the user on the frontend.
